> This is my capstone project that I built within a week at the end BrainStation Web Development Diploma program.
The project is built on the following technologies
- React
- SASS/CSS
- Material UI
- NodeJs
- Expressjs
- Firebase Auth
- MySQL
- BookshelfJs
- Knexjs

The application was built in a week at the end of the program. I have also presented this project on our demo day. Visiting [BrainStation's graduate page](https://brainstation.io/hiring-brainstation-graduates), you can visit to view a video demo of my project. (Search for 'Mutadayin' under Web Development section). I you'd like to run this project on your computer, there are a few requirements that must be done beforehand in order to run this project on your device.
